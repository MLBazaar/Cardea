class Address(fhirbase):
    """
    An address expressed using postal conventions (as opposed to GPS or
    other location definition formats).  This data type may be used to
    convey addresses for use in delivering mail as well as for visiting
    locations which might not be valid for mail delivery.  There are a
    variety of postal address formats defined around the world.

    Attributes:
        use: The purpose of this address.
        type: Distinguishes between physical addresses (those you can visit)
            and mailing addresses (e.g. PO Boxes and care-of addresses). Most
            addresses are both.
        text: A full text representation of the address.
        line: This component contains the house number, apartment number,
            street name, street direction,  P.O. Box number, delivery hints, and
            similar address information.
        city: The name of the city, town, village or other community or
            delivery center.
        district: The name of the administrative area (county).
        state: Sub-unit of a country with limited sovereignty in a federally
            organized country. A code may be used if codes are in common use (i.e.
            US 2 letter state codes).
        postalCode: A postal code designating a region defined by the postal
            service.
        country: Country - a nation as commonly understood or generally
            accepted.
        period: Time period when address was/is in use.
