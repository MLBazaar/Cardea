class CodeSystem(fhirbase):
    """
    A code system resource specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more
    code systems.

    Attributes:
        resourceType: This is a CodeSystem resource
        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this code system when it
            is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This
            SHALL be a URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at
            which this code system is (or will be) published. The URL SHOULD
            include the major version of the code system. For more information see
            [Technical and Business Versions](resource.html#versions). This is
            used in [Coding]{datatypes.html#Coding}.system.
        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this code
            system when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a
            specification, model, design or an instance.
        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the
            code system when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
            instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the code system author
            and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a
            timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There
            is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a
            lexicographical sequence. This is used in
            [Coding]{datatypes.html#Coding}.version.
        name: A natural language name identifying the code system. This name
            should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
            applications such as code generation.
        title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the code system.
        status: The status of this code system. Enables tracking the
            life-cycle of the content.
        experimental: A boolean value to indicate that this code system is
            authored for testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and
            is not intended to be used for genuine usage.
        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the code system was
            published. The date must change if and when the business version
            changes and it must change if the status code changes. In addition, it
            should change when the substantive content of the code system changes.
        publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published
            the code system.
        contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating
            with the publisher.
        description: A free text natural language description of the code
            system from a consumer's perspective.
        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of
            supporting the contexts that are listed. These terms may be used to
            assist with indexing and searching for appropriate code system
            instances.
        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the code system is
            intended to be used.
        purpose: Explaination of why this code system is needed and why it has
            been designed as it has.
        copyright: A copyright statement relating to the code system and/or
            its contents. Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on
            the use and publishing of the code system.
        caseSensitive: If code comparison is case sensitive when codes within
            this system are compared to each other.
        valueSet: Canonical URL of value set that contains the entire code
            system.
        hierarchyMeaning: The meaning of the hierarchy of concepts.
        compositional: True If code system defines a post-composition grammar.
        versionNeeded: This flag is used to signify that the code system has
            not (or does not) maintain the definitions, and a version must be
            specified when referencing this code system.
        content: How much of the content of the code system - the concepts and
            codes it defines - are represented in this resource.
        count: The total number of concepts defined by the code system. Where
            the code system has a compositional grammar, the count refers to the
            number of base (primitive) concepts.
        filter: A filter that can be used in a value set compose statement
            when selecting concepts using a filter.
        property: A property defines an additional slot through which
            additional information can be provided about a concept.
        concept: Concepts that are in the code system. The concept definitions
            are inherently hierarchical, but the definitions must be consulted to
            determine what the meaning of the hierarchical relationships are.
