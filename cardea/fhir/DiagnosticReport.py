class DiagnosticReport(fhirbase):
    """
    The findings and interpretation of diagnostic  tests performed on
    patients, groups of patients, devices, and locations, and/or specimens
    derived from these. The report includes clinical context such as
    requesting and provider information, and some mix of atomic results,
    images, textual and coded interpretations, and formatted
    representation of diagnostic reports.

    Attributes:
        resourceType: This is a DiagnosticReport resource
        identifier: Identifiers assigned to this report by the performer or
            other systems.
        basedOn: Details concerning a test or procedure requested.
        status: The status of the diagnostic report as a whole.
        category: A code that classifies the clinical discipline, department
            or diagnostic service that created the report (e.g. cardiology,
            biochemistry, hematology, MRI). This is used for searching, sorting
            and display purposes.
        code: A code or name that describes this diagnostic report.
        subject: The subject of the report. Usually, but not always, this is a
            patient. However diagnostic services also perform analyses on
            specimens collected from a variety of other sources.
        context: The healthcare event  (e.g. a patient and healthcare provider
            interaction) which this DiagnosticReport per is about.
        effectiveDateTime: The time or time-period the observed values are
            related to. When the subject of the report is a patient, this is
            usually either the time of the procedure or of specimen collection(s),
            but very often the source of the date/time is not known, only the
            date/time itself.
        effectivePeriod: The time or time-period the observed values are
            related to. When the subject of the report is a patient, this is
            usually either the time of the procedure or of specimen collection(s),
            but very often the source of the date/time is not known, only the
            date/time itself.
        issued: The date and time that this version of the report was released
            from the source diagnostic service.
        performer: Indicates who or what participated in producing the report.
        specimen: Details about the specimens on which this diagnostic report
            is based.
        result: Observations that are part of this diagnostic report.
            Observations can be simple name/value pairs (e.g. "atomic" results),
            or they can be grouping observations that include references to other
            members of the group (e.g. "panels").
        imagingStudy: One or more links to full details of any imaging
            performed during the diagnostic investigation. Typically, this is
            imaging performed by DICOM enabled modalities, but this is not
            required. A fully enabled PACS viewer can use this information to
            provide views of the source images.
        image: A list of key images associated with this report. The images
            are generally created during the diagnostic process, and may be
            directly of the patient, or of treated specimens (i.e. slides of
            interest).
        conclusion: Concise and clinically contextualized impression / summary
            of the diagnostic report.
        codedDiagnosis: Codes for the conclusion.
        presentedForm: Rich text representation of the entire result as issued
            by the diagnostic service. Multiple formats are allowed but they SHALL
            be semantically equivalent.
