class ElementDefinition(fhirbase):
    """
    Captures constraints on each element within the resource, profile, or
    extension.

    Args:
        path: The path identifies the element and is expressed as a
            "."-separated list of ancestor elements, beginning with the name of
            the resource or extension.
        representation: Codes that define how this element is represented in
            instances, when the deviation varies from the normal case.
        sliceName: The name of this element definition slice, when slicing is
            working. The name must be a token with no dots or spaces. This is a
            unique name referring to a specific set of constraints applied to this
            element, used to provide a name to different slices of the same
            element.
        label: A single preferred label which is the text to display beside
            the element indicating its meaning or to use to prompt for the element
            in a user display or form.
        code: A code that has the same meaning as the element in a particular
            terminology.
        slicing: Indicates that the element is sliced into a set of
            alternative definitions (i.e. in a structure definition, there are
            multiple different constraints on a single element in the base
            resource). Slicing can be used in any resource that has cardinality
            ..* on the base resource, or any resource with a choice of types. The
            set of slices is any elements that come after this in the element
            sequence that have the same path, until a shorter path occurs (the
            shorter path terminates the set).
        short: A concise description of what this element means (e.g. for use
            in autogenerated summaries).
        definition: Provides a complete explanation of the meaning of the data
            element for human readability.  For the case of elements derived from
            existing elements (e.g. constraints), the definition SHALL be
            consistent with the base definition, but convey the meaning of the
            element in the particular context of use of the resource.
        comment: Explanatory notes and implementation guidance about the data
            element, including notes about how to use the data properly,
            exceptions to proper use, etc.
        requirements: This element is for traceability of why the element was
            created and why the constraints exist as they do. This may be used to
            point to source materials or specifications that drove the structure
            of this element.
        alias: Identifies additional names by which this element might also be
            known.
        min: The minimum number of times this element SHALL appear in the
            instance.
        max: The maximum number of times this element is permitted to appear
            in the instance.
        base: Information about the base definition of the element, provided
            to make it unnecessary for tools to trace the deviation of the element
            through the derived and related profiles. This information is provided
            when the element definition is not the original definition of an
            element - i.g. either in a constraint on another type, or for elements
            from a super type in a snap shot.
        contentReference: Identifies the identity of an element defined
            elsewhere in the profile whose content rules should be applied to the
            current element.
        type: The data type or resource that the value of this element is
            permitted to be.
        defaultValueBoolean: The value that should be used if there is no
            value stated in the instance (e.g. 'if not otherwise specified, the

        mustSupport: If true, implementations that produce or consume
            resources SHALL provide "support" for the element in some meaningful
            way.  If false, the element may be ignored and not supported.
        isModifier: If true, the value of this element affects the
            interpretation of the element or resource that contains it, and the
            value of the element cannot be ignored. Typically, this is used for
            status, negation and qualification codes. The effect of this is that
            the element cannot be ignored by systems: they SHALL either recognize
            the element and process it, and/or a pre-determination has been made
            that it is not relevant to their particular system.
        isSummary: Whether the element should be included if a client requests
            a search with the parameter _summary=true.
        binding: Binds to a value set if this element is coded (code, Coding,
            CodeableConcept, Quantity), or the data types (string, uri).
        mapping: Identifies a concept from an external specification that
            roughly corresponds to this element.
