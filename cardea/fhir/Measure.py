    """
    The Measure resource provides the definition of a quality measure.

    Attributes:
        resourceType: This is a Measure resource
        url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this measure when it is
            referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This
            SHALL be a URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at
            which this measure is (or will be) published. The URL SHOULD include
            the major version of the measure. For more information see [Technical
            and Business Versions](resource.html#versions).
        identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this measure
            when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a
            specification, model, design or an instance.
        version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the
            measure when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
            instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the measure author and
            is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a
            timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There
            is also no expectation that versions can be placed in a
            lexicographical sequence. To provide a version consistent with the
            Decision Support Service specification, use the format
            Major.Minor.Revision (e.g. 1.0.0). For more information on versioning
            knowledge assets, refer to the Decision Support Service specification.
            Note that a version is required for non-experimental active artifacts.
        name: A natural language name identifying the measure. This name
            should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
            applications such as code generation.

            authored for testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing), and
            is not intended to be used for genuine usage.
        date: The date  (and optionally time) when the measure was published.
            The date must change if and when the business version changes and it
            must change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change
            when the substantive content of the measure changes.
        publisher: The name of the individual or organization that published
            the measure.
        description: A free text natural language description of the measure
            from a consumer's perspective.
        purpose: Explaination of why this measure is needed and why it has
            been designed as it has.
        usage: A detailed description of how the measure is used from a
            clinical perspective.
        approvalDate: The date on which the resource content was approved by
            the publisher. Approval happens once when the content is officially
            approved for usage.
        lastReviewDate: The date on which the resource content was last
            reviewed. Review happens periodically after approval, but doesn't
            change the original approval date.
        effectivePeriod: The period during which the measure content was or is
            planned to be in active use.
        useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of
            supporting the contexts that are listed. These terms may be used to
            assist with indexing and searching for appropriate measure instances.
        jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the measure is
            intended to be used.
        topic: Descriptive topics related to the content of the measure.
            Topics provide a high-level categorization of the type of the measure
            that can be useful for filtering and searching.
        contributor: A contributor to the content of the measure, including
            authors, editors, reviewers, and endorsers.

            by the measure.
        scoring: Indicates how the calculation is performed for the measure,
            including proportion, ratio, continuous variable, and cohort. The
            value set is extensible, allowing additional measure scoring types to
            be represented.
        compositeScoring: If this is a composite measure, the scoring method
            used to combine the component measures to determine the composite
            score.
        type: Indicates whether the measure is used to examine a process, an
            outcome over time, a patient-reported outcome, or a structure measure
            such as utilization.
        riskAdjustment: A description of the risk adjustment factors that may
            impact the resulting score for the measure and how they may be
            accounted for when computing and reporting measure results.
        rateAggregation: Describes how to combine the information calculated,
            based on logic in each of several populations, into one summarized
            result.
        rationale: Provides a succint statement of the need for the measure.

            clinical guidelines or other clinical recommendations supporting the
            measure.
        improvementNotation: Information on whether an increase or decrease in
            score is the preferred result (e.g., a higher score indicates better
            quality OR a lower score indicates better quality OR quality is whthin
            a range).
        definition: Provides a description of an individual term used within
            the measure.
        guidance: Additional guidance for the measure including how it can be
            used in a clinical context, and the intent of the measure.
        set: The measure set, e.g. Preventive Care and Screening.
        group: A group of population criteria for the measure.
        supplementalData: The supplemental data criteria for the measure
            report, specified as either the name of a valid CQL expression within
