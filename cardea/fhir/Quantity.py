    """
    A measured amount (or an amount that can potentially be measured).
    Note that measured amounts include amounts that are not precisely
    quantified, including amounts involving arbitrary units and floating
    currencies.

    Attributes:
        value: The value of the measured amount. The value includes an
            implicit precision in the presentation of the value.
        comparator: How the value should be understood and represented -
            whether the actual value is greater or less than the stated value due
            to measurement issues; e.g. if the comparator is "<" , then the real
            value is < stated value.
        unit: A human-readable form of the unit.
        system: The identification of the system that provides the coded form
            of the unit.
        code: A computer processable form of the unit in some unit
            representation system.
