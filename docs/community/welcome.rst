Types of contributions
----------------------

There are several ways to contribute to a project like **Cardea**, and they do not always
involve coding.

If you want to contribute but do not know where to start, consider one of the following options:

Reporting Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is something that you would like to see changed in the project, or that you just want
to ask, please create an issue at https://github.com/D3-AI/Cardea/issues

If you do so, please:

* Explain in detail what you are requesting.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement or respond.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project and that the maintainers will attend every
  request as soon as possible, but that in some cases this might take some time.

Below there are some examples of the types of issues that you might want to create.

Request a new Problem
**********************

Sometimes you will feel that a necessary new problem is missing and should be added.

In this case, please create an issue describing the new problem definition.

Request new features
********************

If there is any other feature that you would like to see implemented, such as adding new
functionalities, or changing the project behavior to cover a broader range of cases, you
can also create an issue.

If you do so, please indicate all the details about what you request as well as some use
cases of the new feature.

Report Bugs
***********

If you find something that fails, please report it including:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Ask for Documentation
*********************

If there is something that is not documented well enough, do not hesitate to point at that
in a new issue and request the necessary changes.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cardea could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official Cardea
docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such, so feel free to
contribute any changes that you deem necessary, from fixing a simple typo, to writing whole
new pages of documentation.

Contribute code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Obviously, the main element in the Cardea library is the code.

If you are willing to contribute to it, please head for the next sections for detailed guidelines
about how to do so.
